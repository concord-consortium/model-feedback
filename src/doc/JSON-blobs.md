# Feedback model definitions

The following JSON blobs define the feedback model for the factors
(`factors`) of the model, the decision tree algorithm based on them
(`conditions` and `results`).

These blobs are up to date as of 03-26-2018.

When LARA activities are authored, each blob must be pasted into the model
definition window, where the corresponding external script is specified.  For
instance, the JSON blob for `Trap` below should be pasted into the window
where the external script is specified as `trap.js`.

In other words, **entering these JSON blobs manually is a critical part of
making the model feeback modules work**.

Followed by JSON blobs are plainer explanation of the decision tree logic.

Finally, [this website](https://jsonblob.com) is very useful when validating
JSON blobs when you need to tweak them.

## Plainer explanation of this decision tree

### Part 1 (model run time)

1. **Factors**
   * `m_n1`: the number of times that the model was run
   * `m_t1`: the total model run time

2. **Logic**

   * If `m_n1 < 1` or `m_t1 < 5 sec`, then `MF_R1`.
   * If `m_n1 >= 1` and  `5 sec <= m_t1 <= 100 sec`, then `MF_R2`.
   * If `1 <= m_n1 <= 2` and `m_t1 > 100 sec`, then `MF_R3`.
   * If `m_n1 > 2` and  `m_t1 > 100 sec`, then no message.

### Part 2 (follow water droplet)

1. **Factors**
   * `f_n1`: the number of time water droplets have been followed
   * `f_t1`: the total time water droplets have been followed

1. **Logic**

   * If `f_n1 < 1` or `f_t1 < 5 sec`, then `MF_F1`.
   * If `1 <= f_n1 < 3` and `5 sec <= f_t1 <= 50 sec`, then `MF_F2_F3`.
   * If `1 <= f_n1 < 3` and `f_t1 > 50`, then `MF_F2`.
   * If `f_n1 >= 3` and `5 sec <= f_t1 <= 50 sec`, then `MF_F3`.
   * If `f_n1 >= 3` and `f_t1 > 50 sec`, then no message.

## Plainer explanation of this decision tree

1. **Factors**

   * `mt`: the average model run time
   * `rp_a`: rain probability average
   * `rp_r`: rain probability range
   * `co`: water output estimate from confined aquifer
   * `uo`: water output estimate from unconfined aquifer

1. **Logic**

   * If `mt <= 70 sec`, then `R0`.
   * If `mt > 70 sec` and `rp_a <= 0.4`, then `R1`.
   * If `mt > 70 sec` and `rp_a > 0.4` and `rp_r <= 0.3`, then `R2`.
   * If `mt > 70 sec` and `rp_a > 0.4` and `rp_r > 0.3` and `0 < co <= 4000`, then `R3`.
   * If `mt > 70 sec` and `rp_a > 0.4` and `rp_r > 0.3` and `co > 4000` and
      `0 < uo <= 4000`, then `R4`.
   * If `mt > 70 sec` and `rp_a > 0.4` and `rp_r > 0.3` and ((`co > 4000` and
      `uo > 4000`) or (`co = uo = 0`)), then no message (`R5`).

   Here, the condition `co = uo = 0` captures an edge case when student never
   reloads the model, and therefore generates no log data from which water
   output can be estimated, but does other stuff well.
