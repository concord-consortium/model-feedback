// model_average run time should be greater than 70 seconds → if not provide feedback
// yes

// rain probability average should be greater than 40% (or .40) → if not, provide feedback on to experiment with higher rain probability scenario
// yes
// rain probability range should be greater than 30% (or .30) → If not, students’ exploration range has been too narrow, provide feedback.

// yes
// confined aquifer output should be greater than 8000 → If not, students did not experience confined aquifer being depleted. Provide feedback on this.

// yes
// unconfined aquifer output should be greater than 4000 → If not, students did not experience how unconfined aquifer works. Provide feedback on this and ask to compare between the two types of aquifers.
